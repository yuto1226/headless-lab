# File Upload API (workflow)

When the user wants file upload functionality in a React UI bundle, follow this workflow. This feature provides **APIs only** — you must build the UI components yourself using the provided APIs.

## CRITICAL: This is an API-only package

The package exports **programmatic APIs**, not React components or hooks. You will:

- Use the `upload()` function to handle file uploads with progress tracking
- Build your own custom UI (file input, dropzone, progress bars, etc.)
- Track upload progress through the `onProgress` callback

**Do NOT:**

- Expect pre-built components like `<FileUpload />` — they are not exported
- Try to import React hooks like `useFileUpload` — they are not exported
- Look for dropzone components — they are not exported

The source code contains reference components for demonstration, but they are **not available** as imports. Use them as examples to build your own UI.

## 1. Install the package

```bash
npm install @salesforce/ui-bundle-template-feature-react-file-upload
```

Dependencies are automatically installed:

- `@salesforce/ui-bundle` (API client)
- `@salesforce/sdk-data` (data SDK)

## 2. Understand the three upload patterns

### Pattern A: Basic upload (no record linking)

Upload files to Salesforce and get back `contentBodyId` for each file. No ContentVersion record is created.

**When to use:**

- User wants to upload files first, then create/link them to a record later
- Building a multi-step form where the record doesn't exist yet
- Deferred record linking scenarios

```tsx
import { upload } from "@salesforce/ui-bundle-template-feature-react-file-upload";

const results = await upload({
  files: [file1, file2],
  onProgress: (progress) => {
    console.log(`${progress.fileName}: ${progress.status} - ${progress.progress}%`);
  },
});

// results[0].contentBodyId: "069..." (always available)
// results[0].contentVersionId: undefined (no record linked)
```

### Pattern B: Upload with immediate record linking

Upload files and immediately link them to an existing Salesforce record by creating ContentVersion records.

**When to use:**

- Record already exists (Account, Opportunity, Case, etc.)
- User wants files immediately attached to the record
- Direct upload-and-attach scenarios

```tsx
import { upload } from "@salesforce/ui-bundle-template-feature-react-file-upload";

const results = await upload({
  files: [file1, file2],
  recordId: "001xx000000yyyy", // Existing record ID
  onProgress: (progress) => {
    console.log(`${progress.fileName}: ${progress.status} - ${progress.progress}%`);
  },
});

// results[0].contentBodyId: "069..." (always available)
// results[0].contentVersionId: "068..." (linked to record)
```

### Pattern C: Deferred record linking (record creation flow)

Upload files without a record, then link them after the record is created.

**When to use:**

- Building a "create record with attachments" form
- Record doesn't exist until form submission
- Need to upload files before knowing the final record ID

```tsx
import {
  upload,
  createContentVersion,
} from "@salesforce/ui-bundle-template-feature-react-file-upload";

// Step 1: Upload files (no recordId)
const uploadResults = await upload({
  files: [file1, file2],
  onProgress: (progress) => console.log(progress),
});

// Step 2: Create the record
const newRecordId = await createRecord(formData);

// Step 3: Link uploaded files to the new record
for (const file of uploadResults) {
  const contentVersionId = await createContentVersion(
    new File([""], file.fileName),
    file.contentBodyId,
    newRecordId,
  );
}
```

## 3. Build your custom UI

The package provides the backend — you build the frontend. Here's a minimal example:

```tsx
import {
  upload,
  type FileUploadProgress,
} from "@salesforce/ui-bundle-template-feature-react-file-upload";
import { useState } from "react";

function CustomFileUpload({ recordId }: { recordId?: string }) {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState<Map<string, FileUploadProgress>>(new Map());

  const handleFileSelect = async (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    const files = Array.from(event.target.files || []);

    await upload({
      files,
      recordId,
      onProgress: (fileProgress) => {
        setProgress((prev) => new Map(prev).set(fileProgress.fileName, fileProgress));
      },
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="file" multiple onChange={handleFileSelect} />

      {Array.from(progress.entries()).map(([fileName, fileProgress]) => (
        <div key={fileName}>
          {fileName}: {fileProgress.status} - {fileProgress.progress}%
          {fileProgress.error && <span>Error: {fileProgress.error}</span>}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 4. Track upload progress

The `onProgress` callback fires multiple times for each file as it moves through stages:

| Status         | When                                           | Progress Value       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `"pending"`    | File queued for upload                         | `0`                  |
| `"uploading"`  | Upload in progress (XHR)                       | `0-100` (percentage) |
| `"processing"` | Creating ContentVersion (if recordId provided) | `0`                  |
| `"success"`    | Upload complete                                | `100`                |
| `"error"`      | Upload failed                                  | `0`                  |

**Always provide visual feedback:**

- Show file name
- Display current status
- Render progress bar for "uploading" status
- Show error message if status is "error"

## 5. Cancel uploads (optional)

Use an `AbortController` to allow users to cancel uploads:

```tsx
const abortController = new AbortController();

const handleUpload = async (files: File[]) => {
  try {
    await upload({
      files,
      signal: abortController.signal,
      onProgress: (progress) => console.log(progress),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Upload cancelled or failed:", error);
  }
};

const cancelUpload = () => {
  abortController.abort();
};
```

## 6. Link to current user (special case)

If the user wants to upload files to their own profile or personal library:

```tsx
import {
  upload,
  getCurrentUserId,
} from "@salesforce/ui-bundle-template-feature-react-file-upload";

const userId = await getCurrentUserId();
await upload({ files, recordId: userId });
```

## API Reference

### upload(options)

Main upload API that handles complete flow with progress tracking.

```typescript
interface UploadOptions {
  files: File[];
  recordId?: string | null; // If provided, creates ContentVersion
  onProgress?: (progress: FileUploadProgress) => void;
  signal?: AbortSignal; // Optional cancellation
}

interface FileUploadProgress {
  fileName: string;
  status: "pending" | "uploading" | "processing" | "success" | "error";
  progress: number; // 0-100 for uploading, 0 for other states
  error?: string;
}

interface FileUploadResult {
  fileName: string;
  size: number;
  contentBodyId: string; // Always available
  contentVersionId?: string; // Only if recordId was provided
}
```

**Returns:** `Promise<FileUploadResult[]>`

### createContentVersion(file, contentBodyId, recordId)

Manually create a ContentVersion record from a previously uploaded file.

```typescript
async function createContentVersion(
  file: File,
  contentBodyId: string,
  recordId: string,
): Promise<string | undefined>;
```

**Parameters:**

- `file` — File object (used for metadata like name)
- `contentBodyId` — ContentBody ID from previous upload
- `recordId` — Record ID for FirstPublishLocationId

**Returns:** ContentVersion ID if successful

### getCurrentUserId()

Get the current user's Salesforce ID.

```typescript
async function getCurrentUserId(): Promise<string>;
```

**Returns:** Current user ID

## Common UI patterns

### File input with button

```tsx
<input type="file" multiple accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx,.jpg,.png" onChange={handleFileSelect} />
```

### Drag-and-drop zone

Build your own dropzone using native events:

```tsx
function DropZone({ onDrop }: { onDrop: (files: File[]) => void }) {
  const handleDrop = (e: React.DragEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const files = Array.from(e.dataTransfer.files);
    onDrop(files);
  };

  return (
    <div
      onDrop={handleDrop}
      onDragOver={(e) => e.preventDefault()}
      style={{ border: "2px dashed #ccc", padding: "2rem" }}
    >
      Drop files here
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Progress bar

```tsx
{
  progress.status === "uploading" && (
    <div style={{ width: "100%", background: "#eee" }}>
      <div
        style={{
          width: `${progress.progress}%`,
          background: "#0176d3",
          height: "8px",
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Decision tree for agents

**User asks for file upload functionality:**

1. **Ask about record context:**
   - "Do you want to link uploaded files to a specific record, or upload them first and link later?"

2. **Based on response:**
   - **Link to existing record** → Use Pattern B with `recordId`
   - **Upload first, link later** → Use Pattern A (no recordId), then Pattern C for linking
   - **Link to current user** → Use Pattern B with `getCurrentUserId()`

3. **Build the UI:**
   - Create file input or dropzone (not provided by package)
   - Add progress display for each file (status + progress bar)
   - Handle errors in the UI

4. **Test the implementation:**
   - Verify progress callbacks fire correctly
   - Check that `contentBodyId` is returned
   - If `recordId` was provided, verify `contentVersionId` is returned

## Reference implementation

The package includes a reference implementation in `src/features/fileupload/` with:

- `FileUpload.tsx` — Complete component with dropzone and dialog
- `FileUploadDialog.tsx` — Progress tracking dialog
- `FileUploadDropZone.tsx` — Drag-and-drop zone
- `useFileUpload.ts` — React hook for state management

**These are NOT exported** but can be viewed as examples. Read the source files to understand patterns for building your own UI.

## Troubleshooting

**Upload fails with CORS error:**

- Ensure the UI bundle is properly deployed to Salesforce or running on `localhost`
- Check that the org allows the origin in CORS settings

**No progress updates:**

- Verify `onProgress` callback is provided
- Check that the callback function updates React state correctly

**ContentVersion not created:**

- Verify `recordId` is provided to `upload()` function
- Check that the record ID is valid and exists in the org
- Ensure user has permissions to create ContentVersion records

**Files upload but don't appear in record:**

- Verify `recordId` is correct
- Check that ContentVersion was created (look for `contentVersionId` in results)
- Confirm user has access to view files on the record

## DO NOT do these things

- ❌ Build XHR/fetch upload logic from scratch — use the `upload()` API
- ❌ Try to import `<FileUpload />` component — it's not exported
- ❌ Try to import `useFileUpload` hook — it's not exported
- ❌ Use third-party file upload libraries when this feature exists
- ❌ Skip progress tracking — always provide user feedback
- ❌ Ignore errors — always handle and display error messages
