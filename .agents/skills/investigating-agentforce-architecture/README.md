# investigating-agentforce-architecture

Declared architecture snapshot for a single Agentforce agent: planner + topics + actions + flows + Apex + prompts + NGA plugins. Reads design-time metadata only (`BotDefinition` + `GenAi*` Tooling objects + Metadata API retrieve) — no runtime audit data.

Input: an `agent_api_name` (the `BotDefinition.DeveloperName`) and an org alias. Optional `agent_version_api_name` to pin a version; otherwise the active `BotVersion` resolves.

Output: two files under `~/.vibe/data/investigating-agentforce-architecture/<org_id15>/<agent>__<version>/` — a normalized `<agent>_<ver>_metadata_tree.json` and a human-readable `<agent>_<ver>_architecture.md`. Override with `--data-dir <path>` (other runtimes pass this to land artifacts under their own distribution layout).

## Runtime budget

**30–45s typical, ≤60s hard cap** on the reference fixtures.

A naive sequential implementation (Metadata API retrieves only) would take 90–220s. Speedup: **3–5×**.

Scaling note: large bots with many flows scale approximately linearly in flow count. Each Flow metadata retrieve is an individual SOQL round-trip; a 20-flow bot takes proportionally longer than a 5-flow bot. The 7 planner-side Tooling SOQL fan-outs are constant-cost (single fan-out regardless of bot size); the flow/apex body fetch wave scales with ref count.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Why |
|---|---|
| `sf` CLI (authenticated against the target org) | Shells `sf org display --target-org <alias> --json` for access token, and `sf sobject describe` for the 7-day channel probe |
| Python 3.10+ | `pathlib`, dataclasses, `\|` union types, `concurrent.futures` |

---

## Usage

Invoked conversationally through whatever skill-aware runtime hosts it. Example prompts:

| User says | Skill does |
|---|---|
| `document the architecture of MyAgent in my-org-alias` | Resolve active version, fetch tree, render architecture.md + Mermaid |
| `draw the invocation graph for MySalesAgent v5 in my-org-alias-3` | Same, pinned to v5 |
| `what tools does MyAgent2 have in my-org-alias-2` | Fetch tree, surface the plugin/function inventory from the rendered architecture.md |
| `re-fetch the architecture of MyAgent — I think metadata changed` | Pass `--force` to bypass the cache |

See `SKILL.md` for the full flag table and sample prompts.

## Architecture

### Channel strategy — SOQL-first

```
Seed query: planner_definition_by_agent_chain (chain-LIKE lookup → planner id)

6 parallel Tooling SOQL channels (keyed on the resolved planner id):
    - plugins_by_planner
    - planner_bundle_functions (join)
    - functions_by_plugins
    - planner_attrs_by_parent_ids
    - plugin_functions_by_plugin_ids (join)
    - plugin_instructions_by_plugin_ids

+ Data API SOQL for Flow / Apex bodies (batched by id list)
+ Metadata retrieve ONLY for:
    - GenAiPromptTemplate (prompt bodies)
    - NGA external plugins (when planner is ConcurrentMultiAgentOrchestration etc.)
```

Most of the 3–5× speedup over a naive Metadata-API-only implementation comes from collapsing a sequential zip-retrieve chain into a single Tooling SOQL fan-out.

### Planner normalization — classic ReAct vs NGA

One tree shape, two planner families:

| `PlannerType` examples | Family | InvocationTarget style |
|---|---|---|
| `ReactAiPlannerV1`, `SequentialPlannerIntentClassifier` | Classic ReAct | DeveloperName strings |
| `ConcurrentMultiAgentOrchestration`, `AnthropicCompatibleV1` | NGA | Sometimes 15/18-char Ids (ID-prefix routed) |

`resolve_invocation_target.py` routes NGA InvocationTargets by Salesforce ID prefix (`01p` → ApexClass, `301` → Flow, etc.). Unknown prefixes become `_unresolved[]` entries with `reason="unknown-id-prefix:<prefix>"` — never silently dropped.

### Cache layers

1. **Tree cache** — `metadata_tree.json` is reused unless `--force`. Cache key includes asset-hashes of every SOQL / YAML / Mermaid template shipped with the skill, so changing a template busts the cache automatically.
2. **Channel probe cache** — 7-day TTL on `sf sobject describe` results for the 13 sObjects the skill touches. `--reprobe` forces a refresh (needed after Salesforce quarterly releases that rename / remove fields). Mandatory-field gate: a probe that sees any mandatory field missing (per `probe_channels.MANDATORY_FIELDS`) flips `status: PROBE_FAILED` so the caller surfaces a clean error.

---

## Key behaviors

### Idempotence

Re-running the same `(org, agent, version)` overwrites prior artifacts in place. Safe to run repeatedly during development.

### Partial-results surfacing

No silent drops. Any unresolved ref — unknown ID prefix, failed SOQL, missing describe field — lands in `_unresolved[]` with a `reason=...` string. Top-level `STATUS` is `OK` on a clean run, `PARTIAL_OK` when any channel degrades.

### Cycle handling

Per-branch ancestor-path cycle detection is the primary termination primitive: the same flow visited along its own ancestor chain emits `_cycle_back_to:<path>` instead of recursing. `MAX_BFS_DEPTH=20` is a defensive last-resort guard against pathological graphs that evade per-branch detection; real-world agents bottom out well before that.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `sf org display failed` | Re-authenticate: `sf org login web --alias <alias>` |
| `INVALID_FIELD` from a SOQL asset | Salesforce renamed / removed the field in a quarterly release. Run with `--reprobe` to refresh the 7-day channel cache and pick up the new schema |
| `STATUS=PROBE_FAILED` on first run | Channel probe saw a mandatory field missing. Check `channels.json` under the probe cache dir for which sObject / field — may require org-side feature enablement |
| Tree for classic ReAct agent shows `_unresolved` entries for NGA plugins | Expected — the NGA external-plugin retrieve is skipped when the planner shape is classic. Those entries can be ignored |
