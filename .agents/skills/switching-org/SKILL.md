name: switching-org
description: "Switches the active Salesforce org (default target-org) using the Salesforce CLI. Use whenever someone wants to change which org CLI commands run against — whether they say \"switch org\", \"change default org\", \"set my org to\", \"use alias\", \"point to\", or describe wanting to work against a specific org, scratch org, sandbox, or production."
compatibility: Salesforce CLI (sf) v2+
metadata:
  version: "1.0"

## Steps

1. Identify the org: the user provides a username or alias (`orgIdentifier`). If not provided, run `sf org list` to show authenticated orgs and ask the user which one to use.
2. Set the default org:
   - Local (default): `sf config set target-org <orgIdentifier>`
     - Applies only within the current project directory. Use this for normal project work.
   - Global (only if user explicitly requests): `sf config set target-org <orgIdentifier> --global`
     - Applies system-wide across all directories. Use when working outside a project or when the user asks for global scope.
   - If this fails, report the error and suggest running `sf org login web` if the org may not be authorized.
3. Verify:
   - `sf config get target-org --json`
   - Note: the JSON output does not include a scope/location field — it cannot confirm whether the value is local or global. Confirm the value only, e.g.: `target-org is now set to: <value>`
   - If it fails, report the error and advise running `sf config get target-org`.

## Notes

- Unified CLI uses keys like `target-org` and `target-dev-hub`. Legacy sfdx keys (`defaultusername`, `defaultdevhubusername`) are deprecated in this context.
- The sf CLI does not have `--local` or `--scope` flags for config set. Local scope is the default behavior.
- If the org does not change after setting the config, check whether `SF_TARGET_ORG` is set — environment variables override config values.
