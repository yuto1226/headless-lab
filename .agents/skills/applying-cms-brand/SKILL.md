# Applying CMS Brand

Universal skill for searching, extracting, and applying CMS brand guidelines to generated content.

## Scope

**This skill is for APPLYING existing brand guidelines from Salesforce CMS to content you generate.**

**Use this skill when the user wants to:**
- Apply their brand voice/tone to generated content
- Find and use brand guidelines stored in Salesforce CMS
- Search for an existing brand in their org
- Get brand instructions for content generation
- Ensure generated content matches their brand identity
- Apply brand styling, tone, or voice to a page, component, or app

**DO NOT use this skill when the user wants to:**
- Search for images or media (use searching-media skill)
- Create a new brand from scratch
- Edit brand definitions in CMS
- Generate logos or visual brand assets

## Before You Start

**CRITICAL: You must retrieve brand instructions BEFORE generating or modifying any brand.**

When a user requests branded content:

1. **Search for available brands** (if brand is not already identified)
2. **Extract brand instructions** for the selected brand
3. **Apply brand guidelines** to all content you generate

**Never generate content first and retrofit branding later.** Brand instructions must inform content generation from the start.

## Workflow Overview

Copy this checklist and track your progress:

```
CMS Branding Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Determine if brand is already identified or needs search
- [ ] Step 2: Search for brands (if needed) and present options to user
- [ ] Step 3: Extract brand instructions for the selected brand
```

## Step 1: Determine Brand Context

Check if the user has already specified which brand to use:

**Brand is known** (user named it, or only one brand exists):
- Skip to Step 3 (Extract Brand Instructions)

**Brand is unknown** (user says "apply my brand" without specifying which):
- Proceed to Step 2 (Search for Brands)

## Step 2: Search for Brands

**Tool:** `search_brands`

**Process:**

1. **Determine search query** — Use the user's description, company name, or a general keyword
2. **Build the request:**

```json
{
  "inputs": [{
    "searchQuery": "keyword or brand name"
  }]
}
```

3. **Call `search_brands`** with the query
4. **Parse the response** — Extract brand results:
   - `managedContentId` — Unique ID (use this for extraction in Step 3)
   - `managedContentKey` — Content key identifier
   - `title` — Brand display name
   - `contentUrl` — URL to the brand content
   - `totalResults` — Number of brands found

### Presenting Brand Results

**If multiple brands found**, use `ask_followup_question` to present options:

```
I found [N] brands in your CMS. Which one should I apply?

1. [Brand Title 1]
2. [Brand Title 2]
3. [Brand Title 3]

Which brand would you like to use?
```

**If one brand found**, confirm with the user:

```
I found the brand "[Brand Title]". Should I apply this brand's guidelines to the content?
```

**If no brands found:**

```
No brands found in Salesforce CMS. To use branding:
1. Create a brand in Salesforce CMS (Content Type: sfdc_cms__brand)
2. Provide brand guidelines directly in this conversation

Would you like to proceed without CMS branding, or provide guidelines manually?
```

**Never auto-select a brand without confirmation.** Always wait for user choice.

## Step 3: Extract Brand Instructions

**Tool:** `get_brand_instructions`

**Process:**

1. **Call `get_brand_instructions`** — This retrieves the branding extraction prompt template
2. **Parse the response:**
   - `promptBody` — Contains the full brand instruction prompt with extraction and application rules

3. **Follow the instructions in `promptBody`** — The prompt template contains specific guidance on:
   - How to extract brand properties from the brand content
   - Brand voice and tone rules
   - Typography and color guidelines
   - Content formatting rules
   - Guardrails and restrictions

### What Brand Instructions Contain

The extracted brand instructions typically include:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| Brand Voice | How the brand speaks (e.g., professional, friendly, authoritative) |
| Brand Tone | Emotional quality of communication (e.g., confident, warm, empathetic) |
| Key Messages | Core messaging pillars and value propositions |
| Content Rules | Dos and don'ts for content generation |
| Style Guidelines | Typography, color, spacing preferences |
| Guardrails | Hard restrictions on language, topics, or claims |

## Error Handling

| Error | Response |
|---|---|
| `search_brands` unavailable | "Brand search is unavailable. Please provide your brand name or guidelines directly." |
| `get_brand_instructions` unavailable | "Cannot retrieve brand instructions. Please share your brand guidelines in this conversation and I'll apply them manually." |
| Org lacks Vibes branding | "CMS branding is not enabled for this org. Contact your admin to enable the Agentforce Vibes branding feature." |
| Permission denied | "You don't have permission to access CMS brands. Ensure you have Managed Content Authoring permission." |
| Brand extraction returns empty | "The brand exists but has no configured guidelines. Please add brand properties in CMS or provide guidelines here." |

**Never silently fail.** Always inform the user and offer alternatives.

## Key Principles

1. **Brand first, content second** — Always extract brand instructions before generating content
2. **Never assume brand guidelines** — Only apply what was explicitly retrieved from CMS
3. **Respect guardrails absolutely** — Brand content rules are hard constraints, not suggestions
4. **Confirm brand selection** — Never auto-select a brand without user confirmation
5. **Show your work** — Tell the user which guidelines you applied and how
6. **Graceful degradation** — If tools are unavailable, ask for manual guidelines rather than proceeding without branding
